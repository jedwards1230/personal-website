    description: `Hi! My career began in 2015 as an Entertainment Technician, and after seven years of diverse roles, I have grown into my current role as a Full Stack Software Developer at Atlantis Health. Here, I use my skills in TypeScript, NextJs, Python, and SQL to lead large-scale projects and drive innovation, such as integrating IBM Watson's NLP capabilities into patient applications.

    As I set my sights on the future, my aim is to push myself further by undertaking larger and more complex projects. I am confident that these challenges will allow me to further hone my skills, broaden my expertise, and make larger contributions to the tech industry.
    
    In my downtime, I immerse myself in the world of fantasy and sci-fi, stay active, and participate in trivia nights. These activities, along with the companionship of my two cats, not only provide personal enjoyment but also stimulate my creative and problem-solving abilities in the realm of software development.`,
